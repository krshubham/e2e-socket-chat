# Socket-Chat
+ A very basic implementation of the [socket-io](https://socket.io) API for the implementation of a real time chat system in a mere 20 lines of code.
+ Things which can be further taken include, but not limited to:
    + Adding an auth layer and database for knowing each socket connection
    + Adding end to end encryption
    + Doing some fun stuff(obviously! :P)

### Tech used:
+ Regular front end stuff;
+ Node with express powered by socket-io API;

### Setup:
+ `npm install`
+ `npm install nodemon -g`
+ `bower install bootstrap materialize`
+ `sudo service mongod start`
+  `nodemon app.js`


**Note**: I am going to work on this project for some time now and leave it there for you to fork it and create something awesome out of it. Let's do this!
